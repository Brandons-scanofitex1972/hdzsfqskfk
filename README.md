Just got out of Ask Sadece Bir An, and woah, my head's pounding like a giant bass drum. You ever feel those  s where you're in the plot's passenger seat but the driver's a maniac? That's this one. I still got popcorn kernels somewhere in my hair, and my back is killing me from leaning awkwardly to see past that gigantor in front. Incredible couldn't keep my eyes off the screen, tho. The hero—his name's, man I can't remember, um, Yusuf! He's like if a vintage wine bottle had a nervous breakdown but still tasted expensive. 

Haha, dude, that part wherethe girl says life is a shattered mirror and we are the glue?? Who writes that? Some hidden poet stuck inside the mind of a director, or, I dunno. My spine will be filing complaints with me all night after that theater seat, I'm sure. 

> And that chase scene! Did it even make sense? Suddenly cars everywhere, then out of nowhere a pigeon—explodes? Or did it just fly off? I can't tell coz the sound was cranked up like someone was trying to push the screen over with their bare audio. Reminds me of times I’ve tried to apply eyeliner during a tornado. Controlled chaos at best.

Oh, and wasn't someone asking me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Oh gosh, if only I could remake the 'sense' from top to bottom. The colors tho, insane. Palette of a dream someone had while sleeping on a bed of crayons. I'd say, yeah...𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you love cinematic roller coasters that might just hurl you near an existential rabbit hole. 

This was supposed to be a voice note, guess words just puked themselves onto my screen...sorry not sorry? Gotta clean up those popcorn crumbs eventually, or nurture an ant colony.
